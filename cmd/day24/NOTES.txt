We solve the problem in two steps:
  1. Solve to minimize the number of packages in the first group (n=6)
  2. Then set that number as a constraint and minimize the qe

Unforuntately, the solvers don't seem to like large numbers, so doing the product() of the array won't run.
Instead we minimize the sum of the logarithms of the weights.

The OSICBC solver is orders of magnitude faster than the default gecode solver on this problem.
